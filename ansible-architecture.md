Ansible Architecture
Control Nodes
Definition: Machines where Ansible is installed.
Function: Orchestrates the automation process by connecting to managed nodes and pushing out Ansible modules over SSH.
Managed Nodes
Definition: Also known as hosts, these are the machines being managed by Ansible.
Function: Execute the modules sent by the control node and report back the results.
Modules
Definition: Units of work written to be resource models of the system's desired state.
Function: Run on managed nodes to make changes or gather information.
Inventories
Definition: A collection of managed nodes.
Function: Tells Ansible about the hosts it can manage and optionally groups them.
